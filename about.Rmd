```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

This is a **work in progress**.

Maybe some of the following will appear:

- have a landing page
- create article from notes (if I can clean some of those messy notes)
- publish some of them as posts
- provide links to some stuffs (presentations, apps... whatever...)
